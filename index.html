            <p>
              Before entering AdDU, I already knew I wanted BSIT, but I wasn’t fully confident. I had dreams,
              but I was scared of the pressure and the challenges that come with the course.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first year happened during the pandemic, and blended learning felt difficult because everything
              was online and distant. It taught me patience and discipline, especially during times when I felt
              disconnected and unmotivated.
            </p>
            <p>
              In second year, face-to-face classes changed everything. I met friends and felt more supported,
              but I also experienced one of my biggest failures when I failed a major exam. It was painful, but
              I learned resilience. I realized that failure doesn’t define me, and it’s easier to stand up when
              you have people who stay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third year was thesis season, it was one of the hardest parts. There were many sacrifices and sleepless
              nights, but we finished. This taught me Magis by doing my best even when I’m tired and unsure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fourth year OJT made me understand what responsibility looks like in the real world. It helped me
              become more mature and more accountable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, Ignatian values became real through my experiences. Cura Personalis taught me to
              reflect and care for myself, and Men and Women for Others reminded me that IT should be used
              responsibly to help and protect people. Moving forward, my action plan is to keep learning,
              stay ethical, and use my skills as a form of service.
